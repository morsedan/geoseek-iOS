## Project Overview

GeoSeek aims to be a known name for creating engaging experiences through technology while promoting community growth and physical activity.

This is the beginning of this app. It allows a user to view Gems that have been placed by other users, and place gems (registration/log in required for placing Gems).

To get this project running:
  1. fork and clone the repository
  2. run `pod install` in the directory where the project is
  3. create an "AppSupport" directory in your home directory
  4. within your "AppSupport" directory cretae a mapbox.txt file
  5. paste your MapBox API key in the mapbox.txt file and close the file
  6. open the workspace
  7. install on an iPhone

This project is a proof of concept for a "geo-caching" type app that uses locations and landmarks instead of the physical objects for the cache.
